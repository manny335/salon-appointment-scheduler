# salon-appointment-scheduler
This project uses Bash scripting, PostgreSQL, and Git to create a number guessing game that runs in the terminal and saves user information.
The script asks the user to input their name and then checks if the name if stored and does so if it is not. This information is used to track the user's
progress and informs them of the best number of guesses they've made.
